         <p><hi><persName>"Pygmalion</persName></hi> had seen them, spending their
         lives in wickedness, and, offended by the
         failings that nature gave the female heart, he
         lived as a bachelor, without a wife or partner 
         for his bed. But, with wonderful skill, he carved 
         a figure, brilliantly, out of snow-white ivory, no <fw>496</fw> <pb></pb>
         mortal woman, and fell in love with his own
         creation. The features are those of a real girl,
         who, you might thing, lived, and wished to
         move, if modesty did not forbid it. Indeed, art
         hides his art. He marvels; and passion, for this
         bodily image, consumes his heart. Often, he
         runs his hands over the work, tempted as to
         whether it is flesh or ivory, not admitting it t
         be ivory, he kisses it and thinks jis kisses are
         returned: and speaks to it; and holds it, and
         imagines that his fingers press into the limbs,
         and is afraid lest bruises appear from the
         pressure. Now he addresses it with
         compliments, now brings it gifts that please
         girls, shells and polished pebbles, little birds,
         and many-coloured flowers, lillies and tinted 
         beads, and the Heliade's amber tears, that drip 
         from the trees. He dresses the body, also, in
         clothing; places rings on the fingers; places a
         long necklace round it's neck; pearls hang from
         the ears, and cinctures round the breasts. All are
         fitting: but it appears no less lovely, naked. He
         arranges the statue on a bed on which cloths<fw>497</fw><pb></pb>
         dyed with Tyrian murex are spread and calls it
         his bedfellow, and rests its neck against soft 
         down, as if it could feel.</p>
         
         <p>The day of <name>Venus</name>'s festival came,
         celebrated throughout Cyprus, and heifers,
         their curved horns guilded,fell to the blow on
         their snowy neck. The incense was smoking, 
         when <hi>Pygmalion</hi>, having made his ofering,
         stood by the alter, and said, shyly: "If you can
         grant all things, you gods, I wish as a bride to 
         have..." and not daring to say "the girl of ivory"
         he said "one like my ivory girl." Golden Venus,
         for she herself was present at the festival, knew
         what the prayer meant, and as a sign of the 
         gods' fondness for him, the flame flared three 
         times and, shook its crown in the air. When he 
         returned, he sought out the image of his girl, 
         and leaning over the couch, kissed her. She felt 
         warm: he pressed his lips to her again, and also
         touched her breast with his hand. The ivory
         yeilded to his touch, and lost its hardness,
         altering under his fingers, as bees' wax of
         Hymettus softens in the sun, and is moulded, <fw>498</fw>
         <pb></pb>
         under the thumb, into many forms, made unusable
         by use. The lover is stupefied, and joyful, but
         uncertain, and afraid he is wrong, reaffirms the 
         fullfilment of his wishes, with his hand, again,
         and again.</p>
         
         <p>It was flesh! The pulse throbbed under his 
         thumb. Then the hero, of <placeName>Paphos</placeName>, was indeed
         overfull of words with which to thank Venus,
         and still pressed his mouth against a mouth that
         was not merely a likeness. The girl felt the 
         kisses he gave, blushed, and, raising her bashful
         eyes to the light, saw both her lover and the 
         sky. The goddess attended the marriage that she 
         had brought about, and when the moon's horns 
         had nine times met at full, the woman bore 
         a son, <name><hi>Paphos</hi></name>, from whom the island takes its 
         name.</p>
